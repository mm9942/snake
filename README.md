# Snake-Term :snake:

A terminal-based snake game implemented in Rust.

## Overview

Snake-Term is a fun and interactive way to kill some time right within your terminal. Navigate the snake through the grid to eat the food, and grow longer with each bite. But don't run into the walls or yourself, or it's game over!
